This is an attempt to implement a frequency counter.
It has been tested from 0hz to 500hz on an ESP32 microcontroller with a square wave and seems to be working with enough accuracy.
Not reliable enough for anything that requires high precision and/or response time, althoug it seems to be very responsive.
